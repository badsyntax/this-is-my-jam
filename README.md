# this-is-my-jam

An overview of my ideal JAM stack

- Next.js
- Static front-end - if server side processing is required, this will be achieved using microservices
- CDN to serve static assets - without using any lambdas, we want the fastest possible edge response tmies
- Preview website on pull requests
- Server-side preview - for when we want to preview content changes from the headless CMS
- CMS powered (Strapi)
- Plausible analytics

I might or might not script this up...
